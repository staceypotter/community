# Looking for help

The success and happiness of our users is essential to the Flux community. We are working very hard to make all of our tools obvious and self-explanatory, to make them composable with other tools and make our documentation easy to follow.

You might still run into issues. This page is meant to be a guide to help you figure out how and where to look for help.

## Documentation for individual Flux projects

Implementing GitOps or any *Ops is a process which involves many layers and technologies. We therefore place a lot of importance on encoding shared knowledge and best practices in our documentation.

To be mindful of everybody's time, please make sure you checked and followed the documentation before filing issues, below find good entry points to our documentation

Kind of docs:

- Getting started docs usually help you get set up and provide you with a Hello World experience. Often they convey core concepts as well.

TODO:
- FAQ/Troubleshooting Docs for individual projects
- clearly what the limits of community support are
- how to submit clear information if you really found an issue
- how to buy enterprise support (this would be open to companies who offer support around Flux and its technologies)
```
